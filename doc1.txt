PrecisBox PRD (Draft)

Goal: Users upload documents and receive a short, reliable summary. The system stores the original text in a NoSQL store and stores metadata and processing status in a relational store.

Key requirements:
- Upload endpoint accepts text/markdown and returns an id immediately.
- Summaries must be available via a separate endpoint.
- Status should move: pending → processing → done/failed.
- Include token usage metrics for cost visibility.

Non-functional:
- Handle 100 concurrent uploads locally without crashing.
- Provide clear errors and avoid silent failures.
- Observability: log each state transition and store last_error.

Risks:
- External LLM rate limits and timeouts.
- SQLite write contention under concurrency.
- Large file uploads and memory spikes.

Success metrics:
- P95 upload latency < 500ms for small docs.
- Summary available within 10 seconds for typical documents.
