PrecisBox Demo Note

Context:
I am building a FastAPI application that accepts a document upload, stores the raw document in MongoDB, stores metadata in SQLite, and generates a summary using an OpenAI model in the background.

Key Goals:
- Build a clean backend API with proper validation and status tracking.
- Store raw document content in a NoSQL database (MongoDB).
- Store metadata and job status in a relational database (SQLite).
- Generate a 6–10 bullet point summary using OpenAI chat completions.
- Expose endpoints to fetch metadata, summary, and a paginated document list.

What I want from the summary:
- Summarize the main objective of the app.
- Highlight what happens on upload (Mongo + SQLite + background task).
- Mention the polling endpoints and status lifecycle (pending → processing → done/failed).
- Keep it short and clear in bullet points.
