Team Sync Notes — Monday

Attendees: API, Data, Infra
Agenda:
1) Current status
2) Reliability issues
3) Next sprint goals

Discussion:
- API team noticed occasional 500 errors during high upload frequency.
- Data team wants the summary to include bullet points plus a 1-line TL;DR.
- Infra team flagged that SQLite is a bottleneck for concurrent writes.

Action items:
- Add retry logic with max attempts.
- Add “stuck job” detection for processing > 2 minutes.
- Add a lightweight load testing script (start with 5 parallel docs).
- Log timing: upload_time_ms and summary_time_ms.

Decisions:
- Keep Mongo for raw docs.
- Keep SQLite for metadata for now.
- Add better error messages in summary endpoint (409 with last_error).
